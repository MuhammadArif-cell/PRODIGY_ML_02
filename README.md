KMeans Clustering for Mall Customers
This project demonstrates the application of KMeans clustering on the "mall_customers.csv" dataset to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score.

Overview
The primary goal of this project is to explore and understand customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques, specifically KMeans clustering. The dataset used contains information about customers' annual income and spending scores on a scale of 1 to 100.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "mall_customers.csv." It contains the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Gender: Gender of the customer
Age: Age of the customer
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer
Spending Score (1-100): Score based on customer behavior and purchasing data
Approach
The main steps in this project include:

Data Preprocessing: Exploring the dataset,encoding categorical variables.
KMeans Clustering: Using the KMeans algorithm to group customers based on their annual income and spending score.
Visualization: Visualizing the clusters to understand the distinct customer segments.
